# TODO
- Improve modularity by discrete-ifying functions 
- Improve flexibility of commands, make more natural as opposed to being unnaturally robotic (perhaps by making enums of PAUSE, PLAY, GET SYNONYMS)
- Create a "Get" command that informs user the names of the artist, track, and/or album. Use Android text to speech, somehow.
