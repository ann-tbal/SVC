# SVC
<i> Enter the average, hygienic individual. About to take a shower. 

> Showering
  
> Soap everywhere

> Music sucks -- oh no!

> Soap everywhere, too much time to wash everything off and then dry just to change music. 

> Enter Spotify Voice Command, an app that easily saves you 45.6 seconds of time wasted washing and drying off!

# TODO
- "Play" command
- Error handling! 
- When error occurs, prompt another command
- Improve modularity by discrete-ifying functions 
- Improve flexibility of commands, make more natural as opposed to being unnaturally robotic (perhaps by making enums of PAUSE, PLAY, GET SYNONYMS)
- Create a "Get" command that informs user the names of the artist, track, and/or album. Use Android text to speech, somehow.
